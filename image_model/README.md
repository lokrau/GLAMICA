# Storing and training the image recognition model
## Author: Lorenz Krause

This directory contains the image recognition model that is used to recognize objects in the kitchen (a fine-tuned yolov8n model on this [data](https://app.roboflow.com/master-thesis-ws6ag/kitchen-objects-with-hands/browse?queryText=&pageSize=50&startingIndex=0&browseQuery=true)). The code used to fine-tune the model can be found in the `fine_tuning` directory.
